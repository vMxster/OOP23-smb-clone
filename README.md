# SuperMeatBoy Clone - Object-Oriented Programming Project

This repository contains an object-oriented programming (OOP) project written in Java, aiming to replicate the gameplay mechanics of the popular platformer game Super Meat Boy.
## Project Overview
This SuperMeatBoy Clone project aims to recreate the fast-paced, challenging platforming action of the original game. Players control a character through various levels filled with obstacles, traps, and enemies, with the ultimate goal of reaching the end safely. The project incorporates key elements such as:

- **Player Character**: A protagonist with abilities akin to Super Meat Boy, including running, jumping, and wall jumping.
- **Level Design**: Diverse levels with increasing difficulty, featuring hazards like saws, lavapools and laserbarriers
- **Physics Engine**: Implementation of basic physics for character movement and interaction with the environment.
- **Collision Detection**: Accurate detection of collisions between the player character, obstacles, and other entities.
- **Game Loop**: Properly structured game loop to handle input, update game state, and render graphics smoothly.
